Python (programming language)
Summary
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum, known for its emphasis on code readability and significant indentation. It supports multiple programming paradigms and memory management through reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector. Widely used in machine learning and as an introductory language, Python has undergone major revisions, with the currently supported versions being in the 3.x series.
